# Step 1: Getting Started with GitHub Copilot: Setting Up C# Console App

In this lab exercise, you will set up a new C# Console App using GitHub Copilot. This Console App will be enhanced in subsequent steps to build a Music Store application.

1. **Access GitHub Copilot:**

   - **Open the Chat Window:**

     - Click the chat icon in the activity bar or press `Control+Command+I` (Mac) / `Ctrl+Alt+I` (Windows/Linux).

   - **Start an Inline Chat:**

     - Use `Ctrl+I` (Windows) or `Cmd+I` (Mac) to start an inline chat directly in the editor.

   - **Quick Chat Dropdown:**
     - Open the quick chat dropdown by pressing `Shift+Command+I` (Mac) / `Shift+Ctrl+I` (Windows/Linux).

2. **Create a New C# Console App:**

   - Use Copilot chat to create a new C# Console App.
   - Type the following command to scaffold a new C# Console App:

   ```text
   /new Create a C# console application MusicStore
   ```

   > **Tip:** GitHub Copilot provides various slash commands to avoid writing complex prompts for common scenarios. The `/new` command is particularly useful as it creates a new project based on the specified template. In this case, Copilot generates a new C# Console App named "MusicStore". Try also specifying more details in your prompt, like the target framework, project type, etc., to customize the project creation.

   - Click on the `Create Workspace` button to set up the project. This will create a new folder named "MusicStore" in your current workspace with the C# Console App project files.

   - Inspect the .csproj file and ensure it targets net8.0. You can edit the text directly. Copilot is a great tool to help you write code, but it is not perfect. It is always a good idea to review the code and make sure it meets your requirements.

   ```xml
   <Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
     <PropertyGroup>
     <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
     <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
     </PropertyGroup>
   </Project>
   ```

3. **Run Your Application:**

   - From the terminal, navigate to the "MusicStore" folder and run the following command:

     ```bash
     dotnet run
     ```

   - The console app should run successfully and load the console window with the default output.

   Try asking Copilot for instructions on how to run the application using `@workspace` Chat participant. The `@workspace` chat participant has context about the code in your workspace and allows you to ask questions or get help related to the code.
