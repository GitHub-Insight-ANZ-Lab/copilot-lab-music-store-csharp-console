# Step 1: Getting Started with GitHub Copilot: Setting Up C# Console App

In this lab exercise, you will set up a new C# Console App using GitHub Copilot. This Console App will be enhanced in subsequent steps to build a Music Store application.

1. **Access GitHub Copilot:**

   - Click on the Copilot icon in the activity bar.
   - Click on the "Chat in new tab" button to start a new chat session. You can now ask questions.
   - While coding, use the `CTRL + I` command to get inline suggestions from GitHub Copilot. This is useful when you're unsure how to write a specific piece of code. Start typing and press `CTRL + I` to see suggestions.

2. **Create a New C# Console App:**

   - Use Copilot chat to create a new C# Console App.
   - Type the following command to scaffold a new C# Console App:

     ```text

     /new Create a console app CopilotLab

     ```

   - Click on the `Create Workspace` button to set up the project.
