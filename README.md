# Welcome to the GitHub Copilot Lab

## Introduction

The lab is designed to help you get started with GitHub Copilot by exploring its capabilities and features. In this lab, you will be building a simple .NET Core console application for a music store. You will use Copilot to generate code snippets, sample data, refactor code, write tests, and more. The goal is to familiarize yourself with GitHub Copilot and understand how it can assist you in writing code more efficiently. And apply the learnings to a real-world application development scenario.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the lab, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Visual Studio Code
- .NET 8 SDK
- GitHub Copilot extension

You can also spin up a **Codespace** to run the lab in the cloud -

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
2. Click on the "Open in Codespaces" button at the top of the repository.

## Getting Stuck?

If you find yourself stuck at any point during the lab, remember to ask questions to GitHub Copilot in the chat. It's there to help you!

However, if you're really stuck, you can take a peek at the finished solution here: [https://github.com/GitHub-Insight-ANZ-Lab/copilot-lab-music-store-csharp-console/tree/main/completed](https://github.com/GitHub-Insight-ANZ-Lab/copilot-lab-music-store-csharp-console/tree/main/completed). But remember, try to figure it out on your own first. The real learning happens when you're solving problems yourself!

Happy coding!
