# Step 5: Document the Codebase

In this step, you will use Copilot to understand the codebase and add documentation to the project.

1. **Understand the Codebase**

   Use `@workspace` context to understand the codebase. You can ask Copilot to explain the codebase, classes, methods, or variables.

   Let us start with the `MusicStoreService` class. You can ask Copilot to explain the class and its methods.

   ```text

   @workspace Explain MusicStoreService class

   ```

   When you are dealing with unfamiliar code, you can use the `Explain` feature to understand the codebase better. Select the code snippet you want to understand and invoke the `Explain` feature.

   You can also ask Copilot to explain the code in the repository.

   ```text
   @workspace Explain the project codebase
   ```

2. **Add Documentation**

   Add documentation to the `MusicStoreService` class and its methods. `Generate Docs` is a feature that helps you generate XML documentation comments for classes, methods, and properties.

   You can also generate documentation for the entire project. Try using the following command:

   ```text
    @workspace Generate Readme for the project

   ```
