# Wrapping things up!

So there we have it - you've built your first Copilot-assisted application!

In this short workshop you have hopefully identified how Copilot can help you be a more productive developer and solve problems in a much shorter period of time.

Here are some key objectives you have achieved:

- **Creating new code**: Generate boilerplate code for new projects, as well as code snippets for specific tasks.
- **Generating repetitive code and sample data**: Automate the creation of repetitive code structures and sample data.
- **Comprehending existing codebases**: Get insights and explanations to better understand existing codebases.
- **Writing unit tests**: Use Copilot to generate unit tests for your codebase.
- **Writing documentation**: Improve your documentation process by generating descriptive comments and documentation for your codebase.
- **Debugging and correcting syntax**: Identify and fix syntax errors more efficiently with Copilot's suggestions and corrections.
- **Refactoring code**: Enhance your code quality by using Copilot to refactor and optimize your existing code.

Until our next workshop, have fun using Copilot!
